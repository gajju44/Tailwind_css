<!-- Note: we dont have to do this in latest tailwind version this is just for information  -->

<!-- Purging in Tailwind refers to the process of removing unused CSS from your final build to reduce the file size. and improve performance -->

<!-- this process is done after completion of the project -->


<!-- to do purging we simply have to following configuration in tailwind.config.js -->

module.exports = {
    purge: [
      './src/**/*.html', // Path to your HTML files here its learnings
      './src/**/*.js',   // Path to your JavaScript files 
      './src/**/*.jsx',  // Path to your JSX files (if using React)
    ],
    // Other Tailwind configuration options...
  }

<!-- in latest version purge is replaced by content keyword and jit mode is by default on that's why we don't have to do purge in latest versions -->
